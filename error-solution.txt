Perfect! Letâ€™s now explain **what happened** â€” simply and clearly:

---

### ðŸ›  Your Setup

- In the **Build Pipeline**:
  - You created Terraform `.tf` files.
  - You **zipped** them and **published** them as a **build artifact** into this folder:  
    âž” `/home/vsts/work/1/a`  
    (which is called `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)`).

---

- In the **Release Pipeline**:
  - Azure DevOps automatically **downloads** the artifacts into:  
    âž” `/home/vsts/work/r1/a/drop`  
    (this is `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/drop`).

---

### ðŸš¨ Your Issue
- You tried to **extract** or **run Terraform commands** assuming files were still in `/1/a`.
- But actually, in **Release**, files were in `/r1/a/drop/`.
- That's why when you tried to `extract` or `terraform apply`, it gave "file not found" errors (`ENOENT` error).

---
  
### ðŸ”¥ Root Cause
- **Mismatch of directories** between Build and Release pipeline.
- **Build** uses `/1/`, **Release** uses `/r1/` â€” they are different pipeline agents.

---
  
### âœ… How We Solved It
- **Always work inside Release pipeline's** working folder:  
  `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/drop/`
- **Extract** the files properly into a known subfolder (like `/drop/extracted`).
- **Run Terraform Init and Apply** **inside that extracted folder**.

---
  
### ðŸŽ¯ Next Time, Remember This Simple Rule:

| Step | In Build | In Release |
|:----|:----|:----|
| Artifact Created | `/home/vsts/work/1/a` (`$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)`) | |
| Artifact Downloaded | | `/home/vsts/work/r1/a/drop` (`$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/drop`) |
| Extraction Path | | Always into `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/drop/extracted` |
| Terraform Directory | | Use `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/drop/extracted` |

---

### ðŸ§  **Key Points for Future**

- **In Build:** Artifact creation path = `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)`
- **In Release:** Artifact download path = `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/drop`
- **In Release:** Extract files carefully inside a subfolder.
- **Terraform Init/Apply:** Run inside extracted subfolder.
